### 13 Aug 2025 (v0.21.1)
Bug fix release for #360 / #361 - previously nullable string schemas with a default of `null` would instead default to the string `"null"` - thanks @geuben!

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.21.0...v0.21.1

### 26 Jul 2025 (v0.21.0)
This is a bigger than normal release, and contains a number of **potentially breaking** changes - however in general, these are making it clearer when the code generator doesn't support something properly (eg: it was probably already broken).

The primary changes are:
- Unsupported `Content-Type` will now generate `never` as their typescript type
- HTML form data submissions (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) are now supported
- `text/plain` request bodies are also now supported
- The CLI will auto-detect your formatter (biome/prettier) config and then use that config / formatter during code generation
- Boolean schemas can now include an `enum` to restrict them to literal `true` or `false`
- Server urls now allow "required" variables/placeholders

As well as several minor bug fixes, and maintenance chores. Most notably switching to `pnpm` which will hopefully help prevent issues with missing dependencies or misaligned peer dependencies in future.

**Features**
* feat: allow mandatory server variables by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/341

### 5 May 2025 (v0.20.0)
The main feature in this release is a new `typescript-express` server generation template. Its very similar in function to the `typescript-koa` template, but allows use of the express middleware ecosystem.

See the documentation here: https://openapi-code-generator.nahkies.co.nz/guides/server-templates/typescript-express

There was also some improvements of the availability of "escape hatches", namely you can now return a `SkipResponse` symbol to bypass the normal response validation and sending, allowing your handler full control over this.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.18.0...v0.19.0

### 22 Dec 2024 (v0.18.0)
Primarily a bug-fix release focusing on improving client SDK runtime validation.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.17.0...v0.18.0

### 11 Dec 2024 (v0.17.0)
The main change is that `server` overrides at the path / operation level will now be respected and create an additional positional parameter for these methods when generating clients (closes #266).

There was also a fix for client generation with `--enable-runtime-response-validation`, when the typescript project has `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` in its `tsconfig.json`

Additionally `defaultHeaders` is now optional in client configuration, and the HTTP `head` verb is now supported. The [documentation](https://openapi-code-generator.nahkies.co.nz/) got a few new pages including a roadmap, and some general tips on usage.

**BREAKING CHANGES**
- New positional parameter on methods where server overrides are included in the specification
- Unique export names for Angular services now suffixed with `Service`

**Features**
* feat: support servers at path / operation level + variables by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/272
* feat: defaultHeaders is optional by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/274
* feat: support http verb 'head' by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/271

**Bug Fixes**
* fix: support exactOptionalPropertyTypes on client SDKs by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/278
* fix!: angular modules have unique export names by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/270

**Docs**
* docs: add tips page by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/275
* docs: use with react-query by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/276

* chore(deps): update all dependencies by @renovate in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/269
* chore: dependencies / refresh data by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/267

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0

### 2 Nov 2024 (v0.16.0)
Client class exports will now be given unique names generated from the input specifications `info.title` field. This can additionally be overridden through a new cli arg `--override-specification-title`.

The previous generic exports are kept for backwards compatibility.

**POTENTIALLY BREAKING:** Filenames generated from tags or route prefixes will now follow `kebab-case` naming convention by default. This can be customized to other conventions like `camel-case`, etc using `--filename-convention`

**Features**
* feat: unique client export names by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/263
* feat!: dynamic filename conventions / no spaces in filenames by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/259
* feat: safer identifier transformation by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/260

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.15.0...v0.16.0

### 27 Oct 2024 (v0.15.0)
It's now possible to change the construct used for the "implementation" symbol between being a `type`, `interface` or `abstract class` using the new option `--ts-server-implementation-method`. This is particularly useful if using a dependency injection library that requires `abstract class` as part of its wiring approach.

Additionally, when splitting the generated files by `first-tag` / `first-slug` (using `--grouping-strategy`), the tag/slug will now be added to the exported symbol names, eg: `createRouter` -> `createMyTagRouter` and `Implementation` -> `MyTagImplementation`. This can reduce the need to alias imports manually.

The generic `Implementation` / `createRouter` exports have be retained to keep this backwards compatible.

**Features**
* feat: support emitting abstract classes for implementation types by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/256
* feat: emit unique symbol names for Implementation / createRouter functions by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/258

**Misc**
* fix(docs): improve meta tags by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/255
* chore: dependencies / refresh data by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/257

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0

### 12 Oct 2024 (v0.14.0)
Fixes a few small bugs, and adds support for relative `$ref`s when using a URI as the input.

**Features**
* feat: support loading relative remote uris by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/254

**Bug fixes**
* fix: allow `$ref` to be used as a schema property by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/250
* fix: handle `type: "null"` in `anyOf` / `oneOf` / `allOf` by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/252

**Misc**

* chore(docs): switch to self-hosted plausible ce by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/249

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0

### 20 Sept 2024 (v0.13.0)
This release adds support for schemas specifying default values, and begins validating / parsing incoming request headers. Note: this may be a breaking change if your server currently accepts requests with invalid request headers.

**Features**
* feat: support default values by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/241
* feat!: parse/validate request headers by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/247
* feat: include urls from servers array in basePath type by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/246

**Docs**
* docs: add compatibility tables by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/248

**Misc**
* chore(deps): update all dependencies by @renovate in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/239
* chore(deps): Bump micromatch from 4.0.7 to 4.0.8 by @dependabot in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/240
* chore: update dependencies and refresh data files by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/244
* chore: upgrade typescript by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/245


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.12.1...v0.13.0

### 17 Aug 2024 (v0.12.1)
This release fixes a small typing mistake preventing queries parameters of type `number[]` from building properly, and fixes bugs in the handling of header parameters / defaults and the "escape hatch" parameters allowing arbitrary fetch / axios request options to be passed.

It's also the first release with automated end-to-end tests in place, though the coverage is still low - this will be improved during the course of development going forward.

**Bug fixes**
* fix: allow number array query param by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/236
* fix(fetch/axios): correctly merge headers from opts by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/231

**Testing**
* feat: add e2e test suite by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/235

**Misc**
* chore(deps): update dependency axios to v1.7.4 [security] by @renovate in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/232
* chore: dependencies / refresh data by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/233
* chore: tweak npm metadata by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/234
* chore: use node 22 by default by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/237


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1

### 5 Aug 2024 (v0.12.0)
Another small release, adding a new CLI parameter `OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS` / `--remote-spec-request-headers` that allows request headers to be sent when fetching specifications from remote URI's.

This makes it possible to generate from a remote URI that is behind some form of header based authentication, eg: `Authorization: Bearer <bla>` (which includes cookie based authentication since cookies are just a `Cookie` header, and basic auth as this is just `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`).

The headers are scoped to specific domains/urls such that you can mix and match sources without leaking tokens to the wrong servers.

**Features**
* feat: support remote specs with authentication by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/230

**Misc**
* chore(deps): update all dependencies by @renovate in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/228

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.11.2...v0.12.0

### 29 Jul 2024 (v0.11.2)
This is a bug fix release, solving an issue with the order schemas were output when generating from specifications that are split over multiple files, causing variable used before declaration issues.

**Bug fixes**
* fix: include schemas from all documents in dependency graph by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/227

**Documentation**
* fix: improve seo, use plausible by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/226


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.11.1...v0.11.2

### 27 Jul 2024 (v0.11.1)
This is a bug fix release, containing a solution for https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/issues/217.

Previously query parameters of an array type did not work when a single element was provided, now this will be parsed and handed to the route handler as an array of one element.

**Bug fixes**
* fix: support array of 1 for query parameter arrays (round 2) by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/225

### 8 Jun 2024 (v0.11.0)
This release contains 1 bug fix for default header handling in `typescript-axios` and several internal refactoring changes required to facilitate the work-in-progress [documentation playground](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/216)

Also dropped `eslint` for `biome` because I can't be bothered figuring out the `eslint@^9` upgrade / configuration migration.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0

### 25 May 2024 (v0.10.0)
This release is primarily bug fixes, and internal refactoring to facilitate improvements to documentation. Most effort has gone into the new documentation site live at https://openapi-code-generator.nahkies.co.nz/

It also splits the `cli` from the library entrypoint such that you can now `import {generate} from '@nahkies/openapi-code-generator'` for programmatic usage if you wish, and improves handling of boolean cli flags.

**BREAKING CHANGES**
There are several potentially breaking changes here:
- Dropped the "safe edit region" functionality, I doubt anyone was using this and it wasn't particularly robust
- Improved handling of `additionalProperties` / `{}` schemas to better align with the specification
- Joi validation became stricter for strings with format `email` / `date-time`

This may make some schemas / types change type to `unknown`, and start serializing/deserializing values that were previously stripped (see #200). If you want more permissive types (`any`) in these situations rather than `unknown` you can use the `--ts-allow-any` cli flag.

**Bug fixes**

* fix!: drop safe edit regions by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/198

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0

### 27 Apr 2024 (v0.9.0)
There are two new features in this release:
- [Typespec](https://typespec.io/) can now be used as an input file by passing `--input-type=typespec` as an additional arg
- You can now use a url for your input file (openapi specs only, typespec must be local files)

**Features**
* feat: support typespec as an input format by @mnahkies in https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/158

### 7 Apr 2024 (v0.8.0)
There are three main features in this release:
- Improve json schema validation support for `string`, `number`, `array` (min / max / etc)

- Start using a pre-compiled ajv validator for better performance

**BREAKING CHANGES**
Previously any truthy value would be accepted for a boolean, eg: `any-string` would parse to `true`. Now its parsed like:
- `true | "true" | 1`  -> `true`
- `false | "false" | 0` -> `false`
- anything else -> error
