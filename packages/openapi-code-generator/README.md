`@nahkies/openapi-code-generator` is a CLI tool that aims to generate high quality typescript client SDK's,
and API server scaffolding (routing, validation, serialization) from OpenAPI 3 specifications.

Currently, [OpenAPI 3.0.x](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.4.html), [OpenAPI 3.1.x](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html),
and [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/) are supported as input specifications.

## Changelog

Please see the [Github releases](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/releases)
for handwritten release notes, or [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for release notes generated by lerna.

## Stability

This project is still in beta, and breaking changes are still likely to be made before moving to v1.
However, these are considered thoughtfully and we aim to minimise disruption.

In general, what is implemented works well, but there are still parts of the OpenAPI specification that
haven't been implemented, so YMMV.
