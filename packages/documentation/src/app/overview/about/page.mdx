# Welcome

`@nahkies/openapi-code-generator` is a CLI tool that aims to generate high quality typescript client SDK's,
and API server scaffolding (routing, validation, serialization) from OpenAPI 3 specifications.

Currently, [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/v3), [OpenAPI 3.1](https://swagger.io/specification/), and [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/) are supported an input specifications.

This gives you amazing auto-complete, and compile-time safety. Typescript's expressive type system is used to
make the generated clients feel idiomatic, and as close to handwritten as possible.

### Server Scaffolding Templates
Server templates handle the routing setup, request and response validation/serialization so that you
can focus on the business logic.

### Client SDK Templates
Client templates give you a strongly typed interface to your remote server calls, ensuring that you
never misspell a field name or route again.

## Project Goal / Principals

To make it fun, easy and productive to generate both client and server "glue"
code from openapi 3 definitions. This is code that is tedious and error-prone to maintain by hand,
by automating it we can **reduce toil and frustration**.

The generated code **output should be "stable"** in the sense that it will not
arbitrarily change between generation without need (for a given version). For
example outputting entities in alphabetic order where possible.

It should also be **generated in a way that human would reasonably write it**,
the intent is that the generated code can and should be committed to the consuming project
repositories, allowing it to be reviewed, and audited overtime.

This is particularly useful in the case of mistakes in the generation or schemas, and also
serves to reduce risk of adoption. **There should be no lock-in** - if you wish to stop using the
code generation, you can simply start maintaining the previously generated code by hand.

The initial focus on `typescript`, with an intention to later support other languages. `kotlin`
is the most likely candidate for a second language.


## Compatibility / Completeness
This project should be considered beta quality, though it's getting close to a v1 release.

It does not yet handle all aspects of the OpenAPI / JSON schema specification, but *most* common
features are implemented. In particular at the moment __only JSON__ content types are supported properly.

You can get a sense of what works by looking at the [compatibility](./compatibility) tables, or the [roadmap](./roadmap).
However often the best way is to just try it out with your API specification and see what happens!

The [integration tests](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/tree/main/integration-tests) also act as a good showcase of the sort of output you can expect.


## Compared to other projects
There are many similar projects out there, so why should you use this one?

- Strong emphasis on "human like" code output
- Tackles the program space from both ends - client *and* server, for a **single source of truth**
- Comprehensive **runtime parsing/validation** in addition to static compile time safety

So if you want a low risk, write-once, get strong build & runtime guarantees experience then we're worth giving a try.
