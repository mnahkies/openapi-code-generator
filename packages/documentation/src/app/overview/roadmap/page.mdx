# Roadmap
This is a **very** loosely ordered view of known things that are planned in the roadmap. It's probably not exhaustive.

## Near-term - "Sometime in the next 6 months"
These are broadly speaking the known blockers to doing the first v1 release.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">

  The project was started [approximately July
  2020](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/commit/643a06835bfb6e462fdeb31f5432cac5ef8ef7f5), over 4
  years ago.

  It'd be really nice to get to a v1 / stable release before it turns 5 years old ðŸ˜…, so we'll aim for this to happen
  approximately Q1/Q2 of 2025.

</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Support multipart/form-data (file uploads)

  Currently only `application/json` request bodies are supported properly.

  This is particularly problematic when wanting to upload files, such as images
  or videos.

  Adding `multipart/form-data` support will aim to solve this.

  ref: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#considerations-for-file-uploads

  ### Support response headers

  It's common for important metadata, such as rate limit information to be
  communicated using response headers.

  At the moment this information is lost during code generation, adding support
  will mean that it is typed and validated at runtime.

  ref: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#response-object

  ### Support cookie parameters

  Cookies are often used to store small pieces of information to be sent on every
  request. These are currently ignored, but should be supported.

  ### Review handling of parameter `style`

  Review and improve the way that parameter `style` is interpreted.

  ref: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#style-values

  ### Fix interpretation of `readOnly` / `writeOnly`

  The meaning of these attributes was incorrectly interpreted and implemented. Changing this will
  be a breaking change, so this should be revisited prior to v1.

  ### Clean up / rethink CLI options

  As the number of CLI options has grown, it's been a bit confusing around when options are/aren't
  used, and it's not super clear how languages other than `typescript` might be introduced.

  We should have a rethink of this, and probably separate client sdk vs server stubs in the option
  structure to make it clear when args are applicable.

  It may be difficult to maintain backwards compatibility, but if possible then we should.

</Steps>

## Mid-term - "Hopefully in the next year"
These are items that are nice to have, but generally not breaking and therefore not blocking for a v1
release. There's a decent chance that many of these will beat a v1 release still.

<Steps>
  ### Implement a `typescript-express` template

  [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is probably still the most popular
  web framework for nodejs, with approximately 10x more weekly downloads than `koa`

  It's also pretty similar in design to `koa`, and so it should low-effort to add a
  template for it.

  This would be beneficial in terms of making the project useful to a wider userbase,
  but also be a forcing function to tidy up the koa template code, and abstract it in
  a similar way to the client templates are.

  ### Support custom serialization/deserialization

  Sometimes you want to serialize or deserialize objects in a custom way. Good examples
  might be parsing `date-time` strings as a `moment` / `Instant` instead of the native `Date`,
  or parsing a `uuid` string to a first class `Uuid` type.

  https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/220 starts to explore this idea,
  and how we could potentially make use of a custom extension to facilitate this use-case.

  ### Implement a `typescript-next` template

  [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular framework for building site using `react`.
  An experimental template has been up here https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/pull/152
  for months, but it needs some effort to really nail the user experience.

  This is coming after an `typescript-express` template, as producing the former will
  necessitate several important refactorings that will make this easier to achieve.

  ### Explore test framework integrations

  [nock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nock) is a popular library for mocking http requests
  in test suites. What would an integration with `nock` look like? Or maybe mock service worker?

  Could we leverage examples to create fixture factories?

  ### Support Security Schemas

  At the moment we ignore security schemas, and expect the user to handle this themselves
  out of band of the code generation.

  For example by mounting a custom authentication middleware for Koa servers, or passing
  an `Authorization` header for client SDKs.

  It would be good to investigate how to improve things using declared security schemes.

  ref: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#security-scheme-object-0

</Steps>

## Long-term - "One Day"
This is a set of possible future enhancements, generally covering more niche/uncommon parts
of the OpenAPI standard, that we _might_ implement one day.

Whilst these are lower down the list due to being uncommon (often appearing 0 times in the range of
integration tests we currently run), there's also an argument to be made that unless tooling steps up
to support these features, then adoption will remain low, and so support should be added regardless.

<Steps>

  ### Support XML

  Whilst JSON has broadly gained popularity over XML as a markup for HTTP requests,
  XML isn't dead. It would be good to support it, especially for client SDK's where
  a server might not support JSON.

  ref: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#xml-object

  ### Support `webhooks`
  The `webhooks` object is a new way to declare webhooks in 3.1. We should investigate
  supporting it.

  ref: https://learn.openapis.org/examples/v3.1/webhook-example.html

  ### Support `links`

  The `links` object on responses is an interesting mechanism to declare relationships
  between operations, and how to traverse these, using a static declaration.

  It essentially allows you to specify a mapping of properties from one request, to be
  parameters for another request. Eg: `$request.path.id`

  Whilst interesting, it's also uncommon - currently there isn't a single usage of this
  feature in the specifications we use for our integration tests.

  ref: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#link-object

  ### Support `callbacks`

  The `callbacks` field of an operation is similar to the `links` response object, in that
  it provides a way to specify callbacks related to an operation.

  Much like `links`, it's uncommon to see this used in practice, without a single `callbacks`
  object defined in any specifications we see.

  ref: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#callback-object
