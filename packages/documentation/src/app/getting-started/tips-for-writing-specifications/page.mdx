# Tips for writing a good specification

Garbage in, garbage out applies especially to code generation tools. In short the more detailed, and accurate the
specification, the better the code and documentation you'll get from it.

This page outlines some tips to enhance the quality of the generated code, and make your specification easier to maintain.

## Declare `operationId`s

The `operationId` is used to generate method and type names. If you don't specify one,
then one will be generated from the HTTP method and route.

Eg:
Without an operation id, you'll get generated method names, that might look like:
```typescript
client.getV2ListListIdItems(...)
client.postV2ListListIdItems(...)
```

Instead of more readable ones like:
```typescript
client.getTodoListItems(...)
client.createTodoListItem(...)
```

## Make liberal use of `$ref`

Using `$ref` can reduce the repetition in your specification, making it far more readable
and maintainable.

It also has the advantage of giving a name to things, that can be used in the generated code,
and avoid generating duplicate code.

If you can't use `$ref` easily, there is also the option to [extract-inline-schemas](./concepts/extract-inline-schemas)
which will generate names to avoid inline types, but it won't save you from duplicate code.

Example:
```yaml
paths:
  /list:
    get:
      operationId: getTodoLists
      responses:
        200:
          description: 'success'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/TodoList'
components:
  schemas:
    TodoList:
      properties:
         ...
```

## Compose `$ref`s using `allOf` / `anyOf`
You can create union and intersection types using `allOf` and `anyOf`

**Union Types**
Using `anyOf` we can combine types / schemas into unions.
```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Apple:
      type: object
    Pear:
      type: object
    Fruit:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Apple"
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pear"
```
Produces something like:
```typescript
export type Apple = {}
export type Pear = {}
export type Fruit = Apple | Pear
````

**Intersection Types**
Using `allOf` of we can combine types / schemas into intersection types. This is often
handy for "extending" a type with additional properties
```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Profile:
      type: object
      properties:
        ...

    FullProfile:
      type: object
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Profile"
        - type: object
          properties:
            ...
```
Produces something like:
```typescript
export type Profile = {}
export type FullProfile = Profile & {}
````

## Use validation constraints where sensible

A fairly rich set of validations can be specified in the specification. Make use of these in order
for robust runtime validation.

Example:
```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    MyRequestBody:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          minLength: 1
        tags:
          type: array
          minItems: 1
          maxItems: 100
          items:
            type: string
```

See [compatibility table](../overview/compatibility#schema-object) for an idea of what's possible.

## Use a clear `info.title`

The root `info.title` property is used to name the generated client. Using a name like:
```yaml
info:
  title: Awesome Service
```

Will output a class `AwesomeServiceClient`

If you can't modify the title, you can use `--override-specification-title "Some Other Title"`
to workaround.
