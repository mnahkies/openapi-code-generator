# ESM Support

The generated code should work with projects using ESM and modern versions of nodejs.

It will try to detect this from the `package.json` file, based on whether the `type` field is set to `module`.
You can override this by passing the `--ts-is-esm-project <bool>` flag to the code generator,
or using the `OPENAPI_TS_IS_ESM_PROJECT` environment variable.

## package.json
Ensure that you have `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file.

```json5
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

## tsconfig.json
Ensure that you have `"module": "nodenext"` in your `tsconfig.json` file,
and have rewriteRelativeImportExtensions set to true.

```json5
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "nodenext",
    "target": "esnext",
    // make typescript replace .ts file extensions in imports with .js in transpiled code
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true,
    // optional
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
  }
}
```
