# Authenticated input specifications

Sometimes you want to generate using a URL as the input, but the URL requires some kind of authentication
header to be passed.

A good example is [Google cloud platforms IAP proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/concepts-overview),
which was the original motivation for supporting this, where we must pass a `Proxy-Authorization` header.
Or from [private github repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api),
where a `Authorization` header should be supplied.

This can be achieved using the environment variable (preferred)) `OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS`,
also available as the `--remote-spec-request-headers` cli flag.

## Format

The format of the value is a JSON object keyed by URI, with values being either an object,
or array of `{name, value}` pairs.

For example:
```json
{
  "https://example.com": [
    {"name": "X-Client-Id", "value": "my-client-id"},
    {"name": "X-Client-Secret", "value": "some-secret-value"}
  ],
  "https://example.org/some/path": {"name": "Proxy-Authorization", "value": "some token"}
}
```

As a typescript type:
```typescript
type OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS = {
  [uri: string]: { name: string, value: string }[] | { name: string, value: string }
}
```

## Hostname matching
You should set the uris to the least specific uris you're happy for the header to be sent to -
a full match on the provided uri is required for the headers to be sent.

Eg: given a uri of `https://exmaple.com:8080/openapi.yaml` the headers would **not**
be sent for requests to other ports, resource paths, or protocols, but a less specific
uri like `https://example.com` will send headers on any (`https`) request to that domain,
such as `https://exmaple.com/some/path/openapi.yaml`

## Tips for generating the JSON
Unfortunately it is a little annoying to formulate in shell scripts, so here's some examples to get you started.

Typically, in any real use cases the secret values would be coming from other shell variables, eg: storing a
short-lived access token, etc.

### Use `jq`
Using [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/):
```shell
OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS=$(jq --null-input --compact-output \
  --arg domain "https://example.com" \
  --arg name "proxy-authorization" \
  --arg value "some secret value" '{$domain: {$name, $value}}')
echo $OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS
```
Outputs:
```json
{"https://example.com":{"name":"proxy-authorization","value":"some secret value"}}
```

### Use `node`
Using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/):

```shell
OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS=$(node -p 'JSON.stringify({[process.argv[1]]: {name: process.argv[2], value: process.argv[3]}})' \
  https://example.com \
  proxy-authorization \
  'some secret value')
echo $OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS
```
Outputs:
```json
{"https://example.com":{"name":"proxy-authorization","value":"some secret value"}}
```

## Why JSON
Why JSON you ask? Simply put it has very well-defined semantics, and is easy to parse without
fear of jumbling the pieces together.

I started by trying to come up with a more ergonomic format, and then felt like I was re-inventing JSON
when it came to dealing with all the edge cases correctly.
