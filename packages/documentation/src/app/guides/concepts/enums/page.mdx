# Enumerated Types

OpenAPI allows use to define enumeration types, allowing us to narrow primitives like `string` from being any
`string`, to a limited set of possible values. For example:

```yaml
type: string
enum:
  - Apple
  - Banana
  - Orange
```

Defines a enumerated value that can be one of `Apple`, `Banana`, `Orange`

This is great for documenting the domain of valid values, but can cause problems with safely evolving your API over
time, as adding a new value to the enum may become a breaking API change.

The rest of this page explores how the code generator mitigates this issue, and how you can customise the behavior
if your needs are different.

## Open vs Closed enumerations

We can consider an `enum` "open" if the parsing of it can allow for new/unknown values, and "closed" if new values
should constitute a parsing error.

The OpenAPI / JSON schema validation specifications don't really discuss this distinction, but generally define
enums to be "closed". This poses an issue for safely evolving your API surface as your needs change without it
being a breaking change.

If you have exact control over all your API clients you could mitigate this by first updating the clients to support
the new value, then updating the server to produce it.

However, in most real world cases this is either difficult, or not possible. An good example is native mobile applications,
as there is generally a long tail of outdated app versions in the wild, and as a developer you have little control over
when your users update their apps.

To prevent this issue, ideally:
- Our servers will use closed enums, and therefore only ever accept/return valid enum values
- Our clients will use open enums, and gracefully handle unrecognized enum values
  _(likely by ignoring them, or the entity that contains them)_

## Code generation of enums

With that in mind, the code generator will default to generating "closed" enums for server templates, and "open" enums
for client templates.

Using the previous example, lets explore how this gets generated.
```yaml
type: string
enum:
  - Apple
  - Banana
  - Orange
```

### Server code (closed enum)
For server templates, we just generate the exact `enum` values, meaning that an error will be raised both
if a client sends us an unknown value, or the server attempts to respond with one.

```typescript
export type t_Fruit = "Apple" | "Banana" | "Orange"
export const s_Fruit = z.enum(["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"])
```

### Client code (open enum)
For the client templates, we use a technique called "branded types" to include the `unknown` type in our union
types, in such a way that typescript knows we __could__ receive any value, but won't let us accidentally assign
an unknown value.

```typescript
export const s_unknown_enum_value = z.unknown().brand("unknown enum value")
export type UnknownEnumValue = z.infer<typeof s_unknown_enum_value>

export type t_Fruit = "Apple" | "Banana" | "Orange" | UnknownEnumValue
export const s_Fruit = z.union([z.enum(["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]), s_unknown_enum_value])
```

This prevents invalid/random values being referenced in the code, whilst also allowing us to make exhaustiveness checks.

![Example exhaustiveness error message](/enum-exhaustiveness-check.png)

```typescript
function processFruit(result: t_Fruit): void {
  switch (result) {
    case "Apple":
      console.log("bite into apple")
      break
    case "Banana":
      console.log("slip over banana")
      break
    case "Orange":
      console.log("juice orange")
      break
    default: {
      // This checks that we have exhaustively handled the known values
      const _ = result satisfies UnknownEnumValue
      console.warn(`unsupported ${result}, skipping`)
    }
  }
}
```

Whilst technically `t_Fruit` can be any string value at runtime, you still won't be able to assign random values
to it, as the branded type will not allow you.

![Example rejecting unknown enum value](/enum-reject-unknown.png)

This is interesting as it means that our server can start returning new enumerated values, before the clients have been
updated to explicitly handle them, and it nudges developers to handle the unknown case gracefully.

## Customizing the behavior
There are two ways you can customize this behavior

- Global CLI option
- Per schema extension



## Union types vs Enum types

Currently all `enum` handling for our `typescript` templates use [union types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types),
rather than actual [enum](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) statements.

This is mostly a stylistic choice, based on the authors personal preferences and subjective opinions of ergonomics. It's
possible that an option to output "real" enums may be added in the future.
