# Guide to servers object handling

OpenAPI 3 has a `servers` property that can be used to define the base url for the whole document, or
specific operations. This guide aims to explain how this is processed.

You can find the specifications definition of the servers object [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.1.md#server-object)

This is fully supported, including placeholder/variable substitution, and overriding.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  The servers object is only used for **client SDK** templates.

  It doesn't really make sense in the context of a server template, and so is ignored.
</Callout>


## Overview
Consider an example servers block:
```yaml
servers:
  - url: '{protocol}://{host}:{port}'
    variables:
      host:
        default: localhost
      protocol:
        enum: [http, https]
        default: http
      port:
        default: '8080'
```

It defines a single server, with three variables.

This will generate a `ApiClientServers` object that you can use to create a `basePath` like so:
```typescript
const client = new ApiClient({
// basePath will be https://localhost:80
basePath: ApiClientServers
  .server("{protocol}://{host}:{port}") // the url template determines the build function
  .build(
    "https", // string literal union to form the enum
    undefined, // pass undefined to take the default
    "80", // override defaults
  )
})
```

If you pass no args to build, the defaults from the specification are used:
```typescript
const client = new ApiClient({
// basePath will be http://localhost:8080
basePath: ApiClientServers
  .server("{protocol}://{host}:{port}")
  .build()
})
```

You can also take the default (first) server like so:
```typescript
const client = new ApiClient({
// basePath will be http://localhost:8080
basePath: ApiClientServers
  .server()
  .build()
})
```

## Operation specific overrides

You can specify `servers` overrides at the path, or individual operation level. The most specific `servers` block
will be used for a given operation.

For example, override the url for all operations under the `/attachments` route:
```yaml
paths:
  /attachments:
    servers:
      - url: 'https://attachments.example.com'
```

When overrides are specified, an additional `basePath` positional argument will be added to the operation, defaulting
to the first overridden `server` with default placeholder values.

```typescript
export class ApiClient {
    async uploadAttachment(
    p: { ... },
    // Overridden server param
    basePath:
      | Server<"uploadAttachment_ApiClient">
      | string = ApiClientServers.operations
      .uploadAttachment()
      .build(),
    timeout?: number,
    opts: RequestInit = {},
  ): Promise<Res<202, void>> {
    ...
  }
}
```

As you can see the overrides for each operation are exposed as `ApiClientServers.operations.<operationId>()` following
the same pattern as the root servers.

## Configuration
This behavior is optional, and be turned off by passing:
```
--enable-typed-base-paths=false
```

When disabled `basePath: string` parameters will still be added to operations that have a `servers` override, but
no code based on the `url` or `variables` will be generated.
