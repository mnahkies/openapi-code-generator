# Content-Type

Content type refers to the media type used for request and response bodies. This page outlines which are
currently supported by the code generator and any further considerations.

## `application/json`

| Template           | Supported | Notes |
|:-------------------|:---------:|------:|
| typescript-angular |     ✅     |       |
| typescript-axios   |     ✅     |       |
| typescript-express |     ✅     |       |
| typescript-fetch   |     ✅     |       |
| typescript-koa     |     ✅     |       |

The code generation works best with JSON content right now. It can be considered fully supported
across both requests and responses.

Additionally, specialized JSON `Content-Type` are supported such as `application/merge-patch+json`
and `application/scim+json`, and the clients will send the exact `Content-Type` as defined in your
openapi specification.

Eg: if `application/json;okta-version=1.0.0` is defined as the request body media type, this exact
string will be sent to the server in the `Content-Type` header.

## `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

| Template           | Supported |                                           Notes |
|:-------------------|:---------:|------------------------------------------------:|
| typescript-angular |    🚫     |                                                 |
| typescript-axios   |     ✅     |                                                 |
| typescript-express |    🚧     | Encoding (`style`/`explode`) currently ignored. |
| typescript-fetch   |     ✅     |                                                 |
| typescript-koa     |    🚧     | Encoding (`style`/`explode`) currently ignored. |

There is fairly good support for form data requests across the client and server templates. The clients support,
and respect `encoding` such that you can customize the serialization of nested objects and arrays.

However, to quote [whatwg](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#application/x-www-form-urlencoded):

> The application/x-www-form-urlencoded format is in many ways an aberrant monstrosity, the result of many years
> of implementation accidents and compromises leading to a set of requirements necessary for interoperability,
> but in no way representing good design practices.

It's a format rife with issues, and undefined behavior. It's strongly recommended that you use `application/json`
instead where possible, and limit the usage of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to endpoints that are handling
plain html forum submissions, with a flat schema structure. This should largely avoid the undefined behavior.

See the test suite at [url-search-param.spec.ts](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/blob/main/packages/typescript-common-runtime/src/request-bodies/url-search-params.spec.ts)
for details of how the `style` and `explode` properties of encoding impact serialization of request bodies in the client templates.

Briefly:
- [RFC 1866 8.2.1.](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1866#section-8.2) is strictly followed,
  meaning all non-alphanumeric characters are percent-encoded, always. Including `[]` and `:`.
  Spaces are special cased and converted to `+`
- `style: deepObject` with `explode: true` encoding aligns to the way the Stripe API and [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/recommendations/#filtering) work.
  Namely using `[]` to represent sub-paths. Eg: `{"foo": {"bar": {"baz": true}}}` becomes `foo[bar][baz]=true` (with percent-encoding applied)

## `text/plain`

| Template           | Supported |                                                               Notes |

| typescript-axios   |     ✅     |                                                                     |
| typescript-express |    🚧     | Supported for request bodies, responses require use of escape-hatch |

| typescript-koa     |    🚧     | Supported for request bodies, responses require use of escape-hatch |

Plain text requests and responses are fully supported by the client templates, and partially supported
by the server templates. Full support is expected to land soon.

## `multipart/form-data`

🚫 Not yet supported. Coming soon.

## `application/octet-stream`

| Template           | Supported |                                                                           Notes |
|:-------------------|:---------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| typescript-angular |     ✅     |                                Uses `Blob` for request bodies and response data |
| typescript-axios   |     ✅     |                         Uses `Blob` for request bodies, and response `res.data` |
| typescript-express |     ✅     |                              Parses request bodies to `Blob`, serializes `Blob` |
| typescript-fetch   |     ✅     | Pass a `Blob` for request bodies, access using `res.blob()` for response bodies |
| typescript-koa     |     ✅     |                              Parses request bodies to `Blob`, serializes `Blob` |

### Controlling Maximum Request Body size (server templates)
By default, a maximum of `10mb` is used as the maximum request body size for binary data. You can override this for
an individual schema by using the `maxLength` field, which will be interpreted as `bytes`, eg:

```yaml
post:
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/octet-stream:
        schema:
          type: string
          format: binary
          maxLength: 20971520 # 20mb in bytes
```

This only applies to server templates.

## Selecting between multiple possible `Content-Type`

It's possible for endpoints to define multiple acceptable `Content-Type` for their request bodies, and responses.

Currently, the code generation does not support selecting between these at runtime, but rather picks the best supported
one and generates code for that.

Its planned to improve this in future, by using the `Accept` header for true content negotiation across all supported
media types, and some way to qualify the content type of the request body when making client calls.

## Other formats

Is there another format you'd like to see supported? Open an [issue over on github](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/issues) and it will be considered.
