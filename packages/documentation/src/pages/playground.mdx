# Playground
Lightweight way to experiment with the different templates and configuration options from the comfort of your browser.
Some configuration options, such as typespec support are not yet exposed, and performance in-browser is relatively poor for large specifications (eg: the Github API sample).

See the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli-options) for details of each option, or jump over to [quick start](/getting-started/quick-start) to get started locally.
