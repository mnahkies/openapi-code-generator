## CLI Configuration Reference
All CLI options can be provided as command-line parameters, or environment variables as you prefer.


## Generate

The default action is to run code generation.

### Required Parameters

#### `-i --input <value>`
As environment variable `OPENAPI_INPUT`

Path to the input specification to generate from. Either a local path, or a url may be provided, though not all
specifications will build correctly from a url.

By default, this must be a [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/v3) or [OpenAPI 3.1](https://swagger.io/specification/)
specification, in either `YAML` or `JSON` format.

When used in conjunction with `--input-type typespec` then a [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/) specification can be
supplied instead.

#### `-o --output <value>`
As environment variable `OPENAPI_OUTPUT`

directory to output generated code (env: )

#### `-t --template <value>`
As environment variable `OPENAPI_TEMPLATE`

Which template you wish to generate, one of:
- [typescript-koa](../guides/server-templates/typescript-koa)
- [typescript-fetch](../guides/client-templates/typescript-fetch)
- [typescript-axios](../guides/client-templates/typescript-axios)
- [typescript-angular](../guides/client-templates/typescript-angular)


### Optional Parameters

#### `--input-type <value>`
As environment variable `OPENAPI_INPUT_TYPE`

What type of input file is being provided, one of:
- `openapi3` (**default**)
- `typespec`

#### `-s --schema-builder <value>`
As environment variable `OPENAPI_SCHEMA_BUILDER`

Which runtime schema parsing library to use, one of:
- `zod` (default)
- `joi`


#### `--grouping-strategy <value>` (experimental)
As environment variable `OPENAPI_GROUPING_STRATEGY`

Strategy to use for splitting output into separate files. Set to none for a single `generated.ts` file, one of:
- `none` don't split output, yield single `generated.ts` (default)
- `first-tag` group operations based on their first `tag`
- `first-slug` group operations based on their first route slug/segment


#### `--enable-runtime-response-validation` (experimental)
As environment variable `OPENAPI_ENABLE_RUNTIME_RESPONSE_VALIDATION`

Controls whether to validate response bodies using the chosen runtime schema library.

Default `false`

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Note: this is currently always `true` for server templates, and only applies to the client library templates.
</Callout>

#### `--enable-typed-base-paths` (client sdks only)
As environment variable `OPENAPI_ENABLE_TYPED_BASE_PATHS`

Controls whether to generate a union-type of string literals + `string` from the openapi specifications
array of server urls. Handy for intellisense.

Default: `true`

#### `--extract-inline-schemas` (experimental)
As environment variable `OPENAPI_EXTRACT_INLINE_SCHEMAS`

Generate names based on usage, and extract in-line schemas to be standalone types / schemas in the
generated code. This is especially useful when dealing with input schemas that don't make good use
of named `$ref`'s.

Default `false`

#### `--allow-unused-imports`
As environment variable `OPENAPI_ALLOW_UNUSED_IMPORTS`

Allow unused imports to be emitted in generated code. Offered as an escape hatch if any bugs
in the unused-import elimination occur.

Default `false`

#### `--ts-allow-any`
As environment variable `OPENAPI_TS_ALLOW_ANY`

Determines whether to use `any` or `unknown` when generating types for schemas that don't have
concrete definitions. Eg: `additionalProperties: true` or `{}` schemas.

Using `unknown` will push you towards using type guards / making runtime checks before interacting
with the model and should generally result in more robust code, whilst `any` may be more convenient
during rapid prototyping.

Default: `false` (use `unknown` rather than `any`)

| Input schema                                    | `--ts-allow-any`           | (default)                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `{}`                                            | `any`                      | `unknown`                  |
| `{additionalProperties: true}`                  | `any`                      | `unknown`                  |
| `{additionalProperties: false}`                 | `{ [key: string]: never }` | `{ [key: string]: never }` |
| `{type: "object",  additionalProperties: true}` | `{[key: string]: any}`     | `{[key: string]: unknown}` |
| `{type: "array", items: {}}`                    | `any[]`                    | `unknown[]`                |

### Misc

#### `--remote-spec-request-headers` (authenticated remote specifications)
As environment variable `OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS`

Allows providing request headers to use when fetching remote specifications. This allows for running
generation against remote sources that require authentication.

Common examples include [private github repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api),
urls secured by an authenticating proxy like [GCP IAP Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/concepts-overview),
or just generally authenticated servers


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We strongly recommend using the **environment variable** variant of this option
  (`OPENAPI_REMOTE_SPEC_REQUEST_HEADERS`), as values for this option will likely include secrets, and it
  is best to keep these out of your shell history.
</Callout>

The format of the value is a JSON object keyed by URI, with values being either an object,
or array of `{name, value}` pairs. As a typescript type:
```typescript
type value = {
  [uri: string]: { name: string, value: string }[] | { name: string, value: string }
}
```

For example:
```json
{
  "https://example.com": [
    {"name": "X-Client-Id", "value": "my-client-id"},
    {"name": "X-Client-Secret", "value": "some-secret-value"}
  ],
  "https://example.org/some/path": {"name": "Proxy-Authorization", "value": "some token"}
}
```

A full match on the provided uri is required for the headers to be sent.
Eg: given a uri of "https://exmaple.com:8080/openapi.yaml" the headers would **not**
be sent for requests to other ports, resource paths, or protocols, but a less specific
uri like "https://example.com" will send headers on any (`https`) request to that domain.

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Why JSON you ask? Simply put it has well defined semantics, and is easy to parse without fear of jumbling the pieces together.

  Unfortunately it is a little annoying to formulate in shell scripts, so here's some examples to get you started

  Using [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/):
  ```shell
  jq --null-input --compact-output \
    --arg domain "https://example.com" \
    --arg name "authorization" \
    --arg value "secret value" '{$domain: {$name, $value}}'
  ```

  Using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/):
  ```shell
  node -p 'JSON.stringify({[process.argv[1]]: {name: process.argv[2], value: process.argv[3]}})' \
    https://example.com \
    authorization \
    'some secret value'
  ```

  Where typically in either example the values would be coming from shell variables, eg: storing a short-lived
  access token, etc.
