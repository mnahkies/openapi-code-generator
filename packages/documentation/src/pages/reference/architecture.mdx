# Architecture

The project is still evolving, but this should give a good overview
of the current codebase structure.

Broadly speaking we have the "core" part of the library that should be re-usable
across all templates / target languages, and then the template functions.

Some templates also make use of a runtime library.

## Core

This directory [`./src/core`](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/tree/main/packages/openapi-code-generator/src/core) contains the generator/target language agnostic parts of the project.

The process of generation resembles a pipeline.

### `./loaders`

Loaders are responsible for fetching a supported input format, and converting
it to openapi3 if required, to be handed off to the `openapi-validator` / `openapi-loader`.

Two loaders are supported:
- `generic` which loads openapi3 specs in JSON/YAML formats
- `typespec` which loads typespec specs and converts them in-memory to openapi3


### `openapi-validator`

Nothing particularly interesting here, just takes a loaded document and validates
it against the OpenAPI 3 specification in JSON schema format.

Useful for detecting errors due to bad input rather than bugs in the
code generation.

Due to a [bug](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/issues/103) in `ajv`
validation is currently skipped for OpenAPI 3.1 documents.

### `openapi-loader`

`openapi-loader` takes an entry point path, and loads + validates a collection
of files (`$ref` to other files supported).

It then provides typed access to the raw OpenAPI structures, with methods able
to convert "maybe refs" into the referenced objects.

This is important because one of the more painful (and bug prone) parts of
parsing OpenAPI documents is correctly following `$ref`'s, as you need to carry
around the context of which document you came from.

The `openapi-loader` makes this much less complicated by loading all files up front, and normalizing
the contained `$ref`s to absolute paths.

### `input`

Ultimately an instance of the `input` class is passed to a generator.

The goal of the `input` class is to provide ergonomic, target language agnostic access to
the OpenAPI documents given as input to the generator.

It primarily surfaces API operations, with optional grouping strategies, as a normalized type
that has already de-referenced parameters / responses, and set default values on various properties.

## Templates

Currently only `typescript` templates are implemented, living in [./src/typescript](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/tree/main/packages/openapi-code-generator/src/typescript).

![templates architecture](/architecture_templates.svg)

Each template currently has a simple signature:
(from [./src/templates.types.ts](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/tree/main/packages/openapi-code-generator/src/templates.types.ts))

```typescript
export interface OpenapiGeneratorConfig {
  dest: string
  input: Input
  schemaBuilder: SchemaBuilderType
  enableRuntimeResponseValidation: boolean
  compilerOptions: CompilerOptions
  allowUnusedImports: boolean
  groupingStrategy: OperationGroupStrategy
}

export interface OpenapiGenerator {
  (args: OpenapiGeneratorConfig): Promise<void>
}
```

Where `dest` is a path to a directory to emit code into, and `input` is an initialized instance
of the `Input` class described above. `schemaBuilder` refers to `zod | joi`

You can find all registered generators in [./src/templates.ts](https://github.com/mnahkies/openapi-code-generator/tree/main/packages/openapi-code-generator/src/templates.ts) - eventually this likely be split into
packages that consume the core modules, or some other more pluggable system.
