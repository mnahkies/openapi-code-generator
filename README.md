generating a strongly typed client for large/complex definitions like the GitHub api.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as a mono repo of several npm packages that work together under [./packages](./packages):
- [openapi-code-generator](./packages/openapi-code-generator)
- [typescript-fetch-runtime](./packages/typescript-fetch-runtime)
- [typescript-koa-runtime](./packages/typescript-koa-runtime)

The `openapi-code-generator` package is the main package, whilst the others are supporting packages used at runtime by
the code output by some of the templates.

Integration test definitions live in [./integration-tests-definitions](./integration-tests-definitions) and the generated
code output to [./integration-tests](./integration-tests)

Scripts to refresh the test data live in [./scripts](./scripts)
